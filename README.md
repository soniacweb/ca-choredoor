# ca-choredoor

Part of the codecademy Fullstack Engeering path.

Objective: 

Chore Door
Your mission is to construct a single-page website that plays a fully-functional game. You will see how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interact harmoniously to produce a dynamic website.

Follow the link below to see what your game will look like by the end of this project. Play a few rounds and see how you fare against the ChoreBot:

### JS

Randomly generate the door that hides the ChoreBot.
`randomChoreDoorGenerator()` randomly generates one of three possible values (0, 1, or 2). Need to then write the logic that assigns each of these possible values to a different door where the ChoreBot could hide.
